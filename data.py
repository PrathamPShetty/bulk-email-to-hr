body = """
I am reaching out to express my interest in an opportunity as a Developer at your organization. 
I specialize in Artificial Intelligence and Full-Stack Development and have hands-on experience 
in building scalable, production-ready applications using modern technologies.

I have worked extensively with Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Django, FastAPI, Express.js, and 
Nest.js to develop secure and high-performance backend systems. On the frontend, I build responsive 
and user-friendly interfaces using React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Flutter. I also have practical 
experience with cloud deployment and DevOps using Docker, Nginx, and Azure VPS.

In addition to full-stack development, I actively work on AI and LLM-based systems using RAG, 
LangChain, and LangGraph, integrating contextual AI workflows into real-world applications.

I am passionate about writing clean, maintainable code and building efficient systems that solve 
real-world problems. My resume is attached.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your response.
